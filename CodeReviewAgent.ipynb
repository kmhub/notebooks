            "The provided code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are several areas that can be improved for better code quality, performance, and maintainability. Here are some suggestions:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Error Handling: The code only handles exceptions in the main function. It would be better to handle potential exceptions in each function where they might occur. For example, the create_image function could check if the provided width and height are valid.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Type Hinting: The code uses type hints for function parameters and return types, which is good. However, it does not use type hints for variables. For example, the width and height variables in the main function could be type hinted as integers.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Performance Optimization: The code uses the PIL library to create and manipulate images. This library is not very efficient for large images or complex operations. If performance is a concern, consider using a more efficient library like OpenCV.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Code Duplication: The draw_lion and draw_cat functions are very similar. They could be combined into a single function that takes the shape and color as parameters.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Magic Numbers: The code uses several magic numbers (e.g., 100, 50, 255, 128, 0) that are not self-explanatory. These numbers could be replaced with named constants to make the code more readable.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Documentation: The code has some documentation, but it could be more detailed. For example, the create_image function could explain what type of image it creates (e.g., RGB, RGBA, etc.).\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Edge Cases: The code does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the provided width or height is negative, the create_image function will raise an exception. The code could check for these edge cases and handle them more robustly.\n",
